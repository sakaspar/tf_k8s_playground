# tf_k8s_playground

This repository serves as a playground for deploying a Kubernetes cluster, managing infrastructure with Terraform, and utilizing the ELK stack for log management and analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before you dive into this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Docker
- Kubernetes (Minikube or kind for local development)
- Terraform
- ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- A web application (we will use a recent project)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with your playground:

### Set Up Kubernetes Cluster

1. Install Minikube or kind (Kubernetes in Docker) on your local machine.

2. Start a local Kubernetes cluster.

### Create Terraform Infrastructure

1. Use Terraform to define and provision infrastructure resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking.

2. Create resources locally using Docker.

3. Configure Terraform to set up a network bridge between your Kubernetes cluster and the infrastructure you've provisioned.

### Deploy ELK Stack

1. Use Kubernetes manifests to deploy Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana within your cluster.

2. Configure Elasticsearch to store logs centrally.

### Instrument Your Application

1. Structure log data in a format that Logstash can parse (e.g., JSON).

2. Configure your application to send logs to Logstash, which acts as a central log aggregator.

### Log Collection and Parsing

1. Set up Logstash to receive, parse, and enrich log data from your application.

2. Define Logstash pipelines and filters to extract relevant information from logs.

### Store and Index Logs

1. Configure Logstash to send parsed logs to Elasticsearch for indexing.

2. Use Elasticsearch to store and search log data efficiently.

### Visualize and Analyze Logs

1. Set up Kibana to visualize log data in real-time.

2. Create dashboards, searches, and visualizations to monitor your application's logs effectively.

### Log Retention and Management

1. Configure log retention policies in Elasticsearch to manage the storage of log data.

2. Explore options for backup and disaster recovery of your log data.

### Alerting and Monitoring

1. Implement alerting and monitoring rules in Kibana to get notified of specific log events or anomalies.

2. Integrate with external monitoring tools or services if needed.

### Scaling and Optimization

1. Experiment with scaling your infrastructure using Terraform and optimizing resource utilization for the ELK stack.


Happy coding!
